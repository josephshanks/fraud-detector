## Premise
Our team was hired by a new e-commerce site to try to weed out fraudsters. The company unfortunately does not have much data science expertise. The company asked for us to build a sustainable software project that we could hand off to the companies engineers by deploying your model in the cloud. Since others will potentially use/extend our code the company demanded for clear and concise code that they are able to refer back to after the project is complete.

Deliverables
Scoping document (in Markdown)
Code on private fork of repo on Github
proper functions/encapsulation
well commented

Model description document 
Flask app with well documented API
Needs to query live data from our server 
Needs to accept input records on POST /score endpoint

Web based front-end to enable quick triage of potential fraud
Triage importance of transactions (low risk, medium risk, high risk)
Extra: D3 based visualization of data/trend
