## Premise
Our team was hired by a new e-commerce site to try to weed out fraudsters. The company unfortunately does not have much data science expertise. The company asked for us to build a sustainable software project that we could hand off to the companies engineers by deploying your model in the cloud. Since others will potentially use/extend our code the company demanded for clear and concise code that they are able to refer back to after the project is complete.
